# Getting Started/Prerequistes
## What is PWABuilder?
    
PWABuilder is an open source project, sponsored by Microsoft, that enables developers to build better PWAs and ship them everywhere, including Windows!

## What does it do?

PWABuilder takes your websites URL and runs a series of tests to ensure that you have a _store ready_ PWA. That means that you have a web manifest (link to what a web manifest is) and is served over HTTPS (link to what in means to have a secure PWA) and an extra bonus if you take advantage of Service Workers (link explaining service workers, probs 30 days articles for all 3 links here). 
    
If you're developing with PWA in mind you'll most likely be directed straight to packaging (because you'll have a manifest and a secure connection already). However, if you need to convert your site into a PWA or edit your current manifest, PWABuilder will guide you through this process. 
    
Once you reach these benchmarks, you unlock the key to generate app bundles to ship your app to the Microsoft Store, Google Play Store, and/or the iOS App store!

## Steps to take before you can use PWABuilder

### Preflight Checklist
* URL to your website
* For each store you are going to want a developer account with their store. For the Microsoft Store that will be the Partner Center ($20), for the Google Play Store the Google Play Console ($25) and for the iOS App Store that will be an Apple Developer account ($99).

Anything else you need will be more fine grain details like coming up with a description for your app, making sure you have the proper sized icons and screenshots for your desired platform and if you collect or use any personal data, you will need to write up a privacy policy. This will be discussed further when it comes time to package (link to packaging docs).

## Additional Info

If you are interested in using PWABuilder or seeing how it works before getting started, there is a button on the [home page of PWABuilder](https://pwabuilder.com) that allows you to test a demo site. This allows you to see what the process is like from start to finish.
