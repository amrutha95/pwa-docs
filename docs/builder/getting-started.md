# Quick Start
    
PWABuilder is an open source tool that allows developers to package their PWAs for publishing to various stores, including Microsoft, Google Play, and the iOS App Store. If you're just interested in quickly packaging your app, this article will take you through easily generating packages. There's also more in-depth sections for each of PWABuilder's supported platforms.```

## Prerequisites

If your web app meets a few baseline PWA requirements, you can use PWABuilder to validate, score, and package your application for stores.
    
    


#### Requirements for Packaging
* URL to your PWA
* Web Manifest
* Secure HTTPS connection


## Additional Info

If you are interested in using PWABuilder or seeing how it works before getting started, there is a button on the [home page of PWABuilder](https://pwabuilder.com) that allows you to test a demo site. This allows you to see what the process is like from start to finish.
