## Welcome to the PWA Builder Docs Repo!


This repository is where all the documentation for the main PWA Builder tool chain will live. This includes:

 [PWA Builder](https://github.com/pwa-builder/PWABuilder)

 [PWA Starter](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter)

 [PWA Studio](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-studio)

Documentation for these tools, and for building PWAs in general, will eventually be hosted with Docsify as part of the existing PWA Builder website.

## Want To Contribute To These Docs?
Just like the rest of PWA Builder, the documentation will also be open-source and open to contribution! We would love contributions to the documentation in parallel with contributions to the code bases.

Take a look at the [How To Contribute](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-docs/wiki/How-To-Contribute) article in the wiki.
